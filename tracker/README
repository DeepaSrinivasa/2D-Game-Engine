Project description: My project is about a fireman being tramped in a Dark forest and he has to fight his enemies that is the bats in the game for him to be protected. The number of bats in the project can is data driven and can be changed to the desire number in the xml file. The fireman has the power to burn the bats but he cannot burn a bird which is very powerful. While he burns the bats he should protect himself from being eaten by the dangerous bird. If he is collided with the bird then the fireman is dead.

Inorder to test the player exploding, player should get collided with the single kind of bird. The collision occurs saying the player is dead.

In this project I have shown the objectpooling, hud with the active bullets and free lists, projectiles and explosions.  

Where I got my sprites:I have used multisprite bird, bats and player sprites all downloaded from the internet.

The easiest part of this project: Creation of hud to show the active and free lists.


Problems that I had in completing this project: Object pooling and I had to explode my multisprites which was happening but not in the intended manner due to the positioning of the sprites. Struggled to understand the advancements in the frame for multisprite.
