Project description:  My project is about a fireman being tramped in a Dark forest and he has to fight his enemies that is the bats in the game for him to be protected. The number of bats in the project is data driven and can be changed to the desire number in the xml file. The fireman has the power to burn the bats but he cannot burn the birds which is very powerful.The birds are of supreme power and fireman does not have the power to kill them. If any of the birds collide with fireman then the fireman dies and the game concludes. If the fireman kills the bats first before the bird can kill him then the player wins.  

Inorder to test the player exploding, player should get collided with the bird.
